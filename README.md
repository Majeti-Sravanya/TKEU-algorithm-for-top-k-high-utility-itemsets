# TKEU-algorithm-for-top-k-high-utility-itemsets
High utility itemsets mining is used to extracting the itemsets which are giving more profit to the user. This is one of the major fields in data mining and useful for many real applications. Although the existing high utility itemsets mining algorithms can find the itemsets satisfying the minimum utility threshold. But fixing the minimum utility threshold value is not an easy task and it is often difficult for users, if we set minimum utility value is too low then it will produce the large number of itemsets and if the value is too high then it will give very less number of itemsets. To avoid these issues, Top-k high utility itemsets mining is came into existence that where k is the number of high utility itemsets to be found. In this paper the authors proposed an algorithm named TKEU[top-k exact utility algorithm] that works without calculating and comparing with twu(transaction weighted utilization) values and considering itemsets individual utility values for deriving top-k high utility itemsets. The proposed algorithm pre-process the datasets for reducing the memory space in a system and design to give better results for dense datasets.
